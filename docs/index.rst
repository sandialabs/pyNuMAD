========

The structural design and optimization of wind turbine blades is a
complex task. In many cases it is difficult to find the optimal design
of a turbine blade by hand, or by trial and error, and the software
tools used for such designs are most effective when integrated into
automated optimization and analysis algorithms. A new version of the
software tool `pyNuMAD (Python Numerical Manufacturing And Design) <https://github.com/sandialabs/pyNuMAD>`_ for the design
and modeling of wind turbine blades is developed and described.
