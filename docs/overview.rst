Overview
=======================

`pyNuMAD (Python Numerical Manufacturing And Design) <https://github.com/sandialabs/pyNuMAD>`_ is an
open-source software program written in
`Python <python.org>`__ which simplifies the process of
creating a three-dimensional model of a wind turbine blade. The tool
manages all blade information including aerodynamic, and material
properties as well as, material placement. The blade information can be
modified by a structural-optimizer in pyNuMAD or it can be used to run the
other tools below in a stand-alone mode:

-  The `ANSYSÂ® <http://www.ansys.com/>`__ commercial finite element
   package

-  `Abaqus <https://www.3ds.com/products-services/simulia/products/abaqus/>`__

-  `Cubit <https://cubit.sandia.gov/>`__

When used in conjunction with these other tools, pyNuMAD provides
computation of blade cross section properties, various structural
analyses, and estimation of blade aeroelastic instability.
