Meshing Overview
==================================

Blades can be meshed either with the in-house mesher or with Cubit. 

The intent of the in-house mesher is to be independent of any target FEA code (Nastran, Abaqus, ANSYS, 
etc..). It provides nodes and element connectivity that can be ported into any FEA code. It first meshes 
the outer-mold-line with shell elements. if a solid model is desired, then solid elements are created 
by extruding from the shell mesh. Currently, the code provides separate meshes for the webs, aeroshell,
and adhesives that mush be tied together with constraints in an FEA package. 

The intent of the Cubit mesher is to be able to create solid and beam models that have the 
exact same cross-sections. Therefore, the Cubit mesher first creates cross sections, rather than 
the OML surface shell mesh. If a solid model is desired, then the cross sections are connected with
volumes and subsequently meshed. Since cross sectional codes like VABS and ANBA do not allow for
discontinuous meshes connected by tie constrains, the meshes made by the Cubit mesher are continuous.
The other intent with the Cubit functionality is that Sierra meshes are easily created since it can
directly export into the Genesis format.  

The table below summarizes the differences between the two meshing capabilities.

Meshing with Cubit
------------------




After setting the path to Cubit, import pynumad

.. code-block:: python

   import pynumad


Then add Cubit to the path

.. code-block:: python

   import sys
   sys.path.append(pynumad.SOFTWARE_PATHS['cubit'])
   sys.path.append(pynumad.SOFTWARE_PATHS['cubitEnhancements'])  
   import cubit


There are two main ways to use the Cubit functionality. The first is the create any all blade cross sections with 
:py:func:`~pynumad.analysis.cubit.make_blade.cubit_make_cross_sections`. The second is to connect these cross sections with 
solid volumes with :py:func:`~pynumad.analysis.cubit.make_blade.cubit_make_solid_blade`. Both ways require the user
to define two dictionaries. 

One is named ``cs_params``. It controls the details of how the cross-sections are created. The table below shows
all of the required keys as well as their descriptions. 

.. csv-table:: Key values for the ``cs_params`` dictionary needed for :py:func:`~pynumad.analysis.cubit.cubit_make_cross_sections` 
   and :py:func:`~pynumad.analysis.cubit.cubit_make_cross`.
   :file: cs_params_dict.csv
   :widths: 1, 1
   :header-rows: 1

The figures below also helps to define some of the ``cs_params``.

.. _cubit_sample_TE:

   Trailing edge detail.

.. _cubit_web_adhesive:
.. figure:: /_static/images/cubit/sampleWeb_adhesive.png
   
   Web adhesive detail.

.. _cubit_sample_LE:
.. figure:: /_static/images/cubit/sampleLE.png
   :width: 4.0in
   
   Leading edge detail.




The other dictionary is named ``settings`` and it controls which codes you want to make input files for.  

.. csv-table:: Key values for the ``settings`` dictionary needed for :py:func:`~pynumad.analysis.cubit.cubit_make_cross_sections` 
   and :py:func:`~pynumad.analysis.cubit.cubit_make_cross`.
   :file: settings_dict.csv
   :widths: 1, 1
   :header-rows: 1

Note that "cub" files are only needed if you want to visualize your model in Cubit. "g" refers to Genesis binary files 
that are needed by the Sierra codes. 


Troubleshooting issues with Cubit meshing is facilitated by "{wt_name}.log". There you will generally 
be able to see what parts of the blade have been created and where the code stopped.

**Log File**
A log file is generated that communicates progress. Warning messages are also stored here. Check this file for 
troubleshooting.

**Limitations**
The adhesive width must not exceed the width of the reinforcement. If it does it will be reduced. A warning will be written 
to the log file.
